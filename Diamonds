LÖCKLEDGER will issue two distinct tokens:


BLACK DIAMONDS 21 Million

An estimated 20% of all Bitcoins have been lost forever. To avoid this, we will retain full custody 
of all Black Diamonds tokens issued; you will be given seed cryptography on your cold wallet which 
we ourselves will not know. In the event you lose or forget your password we will assist you with 
your consent to recuperate your content. Black Diamond LÖCKS will never move from our vaults, 
only the legal ownership titles will change. Think RAI stones from the Yap islands, Micronesia.

Black Diamonds are utility tokens for crypto talent acquisition, such as our recruitment for developers, 
coders, programmers, engineers, blockchain innovators, etc. It will carry prestige and seniority, and 
will reward early believers of our vision. Finite funding anticipating a benign higher-order logic, 
absolute universal U-ASI over the next 500 years.


WHITE DIAMONDS 21 Million

White Diamond LÖCKS are non-custodial in our DIFI exchange platform and are made available to friends 
and family and the general public. Finite funding anticipating a benign higher-order logic, absolute 
universal U-ASI superintelligence systems over the next 500 years.
